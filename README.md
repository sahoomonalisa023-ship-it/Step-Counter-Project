# React Step Counter / Step Navigation

A simple **React Step Counter** that allows users to navigate through multiple steps with `Previous` and `Next` buttons. Each step highlights dynamically, showing the active step clearly. This project demonstrates React **state management using `useState`**, conditional rendering, and basic styling.

## Features

- Navigate between 3 steps using **Next** and **Previous** buttons
- Active step is highlighted with a different color
- Dynamic content for each step
- Responsive and clean design

## How it Works

- **useState** keeps track of the current step
- Step circles update their styling based on the current step
- Buttons handle incrementing/decrementing the step while preventing overflow/underflow

## Technologies Used

- React.js (Functional Components)
- useState Hook for state management
- CSS for styling
